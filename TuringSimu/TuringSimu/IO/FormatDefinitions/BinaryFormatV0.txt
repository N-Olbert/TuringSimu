<--To correctly be recognized as a saved Turingmachine from this simulator the fileending has 
to be ".tmsim"-->
uint16_t -> Versionnumber (only available versions for this format are '0' and '1')
3 characters -> type of TM  (DTM, NTM)
uint16_t -> amount of states
n State -> the mentioned states, where n is the uint16_t from before
States are saved like:
	uint16_t -> identifier length
	that amount of chars -> identifier
uint16_t -> length of identifier of the starting state
that amount of chars -> the identifier
uint16_t -> amount of final states
	n State -> the mentioned final states, where n is the uint16_t from before
uint16_t -> amount of characters in alphabet
that amount of chars -> characters of the alphabet
uint16_t -> amount of characters in tapealphabet
that amount of chars -> characters of tapealphabet
char -> blank symbol
uint16_t -> amount of transitions
n Transition -> the mentioned transitions where n is the uint16_t from before
Transitions are saved like:
	State -> the current state
	char -> current char
	State -> the state after the transition
	char -> character to write
	char -> headDirection (L, R or S)
<--VERSION 1 and above only:-->
uint32_t -> sum of the amount uint16_ts to have some sort of checksum
