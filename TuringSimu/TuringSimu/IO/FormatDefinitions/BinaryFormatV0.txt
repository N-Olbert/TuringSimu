To correctly be recognized as a saved Turingmachine from this simulator the fileending has to be 
".tmsim"
uint16 -> Versionnumber
3 characters -> type of TM  (DTM, NTM)
uint16 -> amount of states
States are saved like:
	uint16 -> identifier length
	that amount of chars -> identifier
uint16 -> length of identifier of the starting state
that amount of chars -> the identifier
uint16 -> amount of final states
uint16 -> amount of characters in alphabet
that amount of chars -> characters of the alphabet
uint16 -> amount of characters in tapealphabet
that amount of chars -> characters of tapealphabet
char -> blank symbol
uint16 -> amount of transitions
Transitions are saved like:
	uint16 -> length of currentState identifier
	that amount of chars -> the identifier
	char -> current char
	uint16 -> length of nextState identifier
	that amount of chars -> that identifier
	char -> character to write
	char -> headDirection (L, R or S)
